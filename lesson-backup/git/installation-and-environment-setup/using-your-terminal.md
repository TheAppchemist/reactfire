We will be using our terminal to work with git. If you are working with a windows machine, your terminal is your CMD(Command prompt terminal). It can be located by clicking on your search bar on the bottom left corner of your screen then typing cmd on the search and clicking enter. You should then see a screen like the one below.

I have entered the command git version then pressed enter. If git is installed properly, you should be able to see your git version. There is a possibility that by the time you read the document, the git version should have changed. Ensure it is the same version or above. Anything below the version you see above is outdated and might give you a lot of issues in the near future.

Your terminal is a powerful tool that allows you to interact with your computer using a set of commands. If you have worked with Linux before then you should know a couple of those commands. If not then do not worry. We will assist you with the most common commands you will use in your everyday developer life.
