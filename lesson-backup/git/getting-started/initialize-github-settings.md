We want to first initialize our github account globally on our workstation(computer/laptop). Therefore we are required to add the username, email and password. 

In your terminal(CMD):

1. Enter **git config --global user.name "John"**. Where there is John, place your github username. Make sure the username is in quotation marks.
2. Enter **git config --global user.email "**[**johnDoe@email.com**](mailto:johnDoe@email.com)**".** Make sure the email address is in quotation marks.
3. Enter **git config --global user.password "ABC123".** Make sure the password in quotation marks.
