Github is an open source platform that allows for users of the community to share their projects/source code as repositories. Github is also used for collaboration amongst development teams. Team members are able to share source code with each other while working remotely from each other. 

Picture this scenario; You have 2 developers who are working on a project named myCodetribeApp. Both of them divide the tasks and after they have to complete their tasks they need to eventually combine their individual work together so they complete their project. Normally, one of the developers would transfer his files to a flash then give the flash to his co-developer. 

A lot of problems can occur due to the process; the flash drive could end up corrupted, the flash drive could get lost or worse case scenario, one of the developers' workstation could crash and all the work done could get lost. Therefore forcing the developers to redo the tasks that are not completed. 

Github helps to protect against all these scenarios. Github then acts as a central file storage for the project where the developers are able to upload all their tasks while letting github worry about combining the project. Therefore saving the developers time and reducing the possibilities of error because everything is tracked.
