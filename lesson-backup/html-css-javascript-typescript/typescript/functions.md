Functions are a set of instructions performed to carry out a task. In Javascript, most of the code is written in the form of functions and plays a major role. In typescript, you have class, interfaces, modules, namespaces available, but still, functions play an important role. The difference between the function in javascript and typescript function is the return type available with typescript function. 

**JavaScript Function**

```javascript
function add (a1, b1) {
    return a1+b1;
 }
```

**TypeScript Function**

```typescript
add(a1 : number, b1: number) : number {
    return a1 + b1;
}
```
