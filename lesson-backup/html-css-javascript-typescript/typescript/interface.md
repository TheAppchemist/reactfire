One of the core features of Typescript is interfaces. The interface is a set of a rule defined which needs to be implemented by the entity using it. The entity can be a class, function, or variable. An interface can be made up of properties and methods. You can define properties as optional using "?" syntax for that property or method. The interface adds a strong type check for any function, variable, or class implementing the interface. Syntax of an interface in Typescript: 

```typescript
interface  {
    name: string;
    surname: string;
}
```
