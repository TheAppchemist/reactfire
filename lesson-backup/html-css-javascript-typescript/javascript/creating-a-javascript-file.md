Javascript files are saved with the .js format. Anytime you see a .js it is a javascript file.

For example -> myCodeTribe.js

The Javascript(<script></script>) tag allows for javascript code within an HTML file.

**Copy, paste and run the code below**

```html
<html>
	<script>
		var  myText = “Hello CodeTribe ”;
		var myYear = 2020;
		alert(myText + myYear)
    </script>script>
</html>

```
