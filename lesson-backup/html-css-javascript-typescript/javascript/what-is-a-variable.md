A variable is a temporal point of storage that we can use throughout our javascript program.

## For example;

```javascript
var value1 = 20;
var value2 = 55;
var amount = value1 + value2;
print(amount);
```

Outputs 75.

Declared using var or as a const - **var** for normal variables(string or numeric) and **const** for constant variables.
