Scrum For Teams involves the process of being able to collaborate with other team members through the use of;

* Github
* Slack
* Trello
* CodeTribe App(Compulsory to download on mobile device)

Team members will all be required to have accounts for each and every one of the tools above. The facilitators will get an invitation into the **CodeTribeOnline** and will be given admin roles by the **Skills Accelerator Technical Facilitator.** The Facilitators will then invite their CodeTribers into the group and then individually into their selected Channels.

Codetribers will be required to follow the github installation document process and provide their github links to their facilitators. They will then be required to push all the work they would have done during the introductory process into the online learning.

There will be an open Q&A session on Thursdays that CodeTribers can have with any facilitator within **CodeTribeOnline.**  Sessions will start at 10am to 3pm. To allow for facilitators to have the necessary preparation from 8am to 10am. At 3pm to 4pm facilitators will then be able to comply with any feedback from the session. 

## Slack

Slack is a collaboration hub that can replace email to help you and your team work together seamlessly. Itâ€™s designed to support the way people naturally work together, so you can collaborate with people online as efficiently as you do face-to-face.

CodeTribers will all be placed into one slack group. There will be seperate channels for each CodeTribe facility. Facilitators will have access to all the channels. There will be a general session that all members will have access to that will allow for sharing of content.

Students will be requested to attend Daily Scrum Meetings.Every student will have to be present for a daily stand up meeting at 8:30am that should take 15 min and each member will be asked three questions.

1. What did you do yesterday ?
2. What will you do today ?
3. What is blocking your progress ?

## **Trello Learning process;**

* Example Trello Board
* Demo Trello Board
* Template Trello Board

These are the Trello boards that students will be given access to so they may be able to understand how trello boards are set up. CodeTribers will have a google class session with the  **Mlab Scrum Coordinator.** It is compulsory for all CodeTribers to attend this session.

### Task 1

Create a Trello board named **MyWeek.**List out all the tasks you normally do during the day and all the tasks you need to do during the week.

You will then be required to organize your tasks based on the most important tasks you will be required to complete. Every time you are in the process of doing a task, move the card into **Doing.** When you have completed that task then move that task into **Done.** 

### Task 2

Create a Trello board named **MyCodeTribeOnline**.List out all the tasks you need to complete for the **CodeTribeOnline** learning programme.  Every time you are in the process of doing a task, move the card into **Doing** and specify when you will be done with that task (date and time)**.** When you have completed that task then move that task into **Done.**
