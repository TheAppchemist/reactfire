## Trello Learning process

- Example Trello Board
- Demo Trello Board
- Template Trello Board

These are the Trello boards that students will be given access to so they may be able to understand how trello boards are set up. CodeTribers will have a google class session with the  **Mlab Scrum Coordinator.** It is compulsory for all CodeTribers to attend this session.

### Task 1

Create a Trello board named **MyWeek.**List out all the tasks you normally do during the day and all the tasks you need to do during the week.
You will then be required to organize your tasks based on the most important tasks you will be required to complete. Every time you are in the process of doing a task, move the card into **Doing.** When you have completed that task then move that task into **Done.** 

### Task 2

Create a Trello board named **MyCodeTribeOnline**.List out all the tasks you need to complete for the **CodeTribeOnline** learning programme.  Every time you are in the process of doing a task, move the card into **Doing** and specify when you will be done with that task (date and time)**.** When you have completed that task then move that task into **Done.**
