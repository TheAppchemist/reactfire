Slack is a collaboration hub that can replace email to help you and your team work together seamlessly. Itâ€™s designed to support the way people naturally work together, so you can collaborate with people online as efficiently as you do face-to-face.

CodeTribers will all be placed into one slack group. There will be seperate channels for each CodeTribe facility. Facilitators will have access to all the channels. There will be a general session that all members will have access to that will allow for sharing of content.

Students will be requested to attend Daily Scrum Meetings.Every student will have to be present for a daily stand up meeting at 8:30am that should take 15 min and each member will be asked three questions.

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What will you do today?
3. What is blocking your progress ?
