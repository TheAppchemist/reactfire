There has been a rapid increase in usage of devices over the years. Devices with larger storage have now become more affordable for the average consumer. Therefore making it more accessible for consumers to access the internet. 

Consumers are now more spoiled for "choices". This has been due to the rapid increase  in development of  SAAS(Software AS A Service).  Consumers are then able to pick what platforms best suit their needs but what happens to if consumers do not relate to the product?  If they do not find the product easy to use?

Consumers are never worried or to shy away from using SAAS and going back to the methods they had used before SAAS simplified their lives or switching to a competitor that will offer them more competitive rates. All these facts are normally caused by bad design. Should you really want to build a successful SAAS product that could either be within the web, mobile or desktop space then design needs to become a focus. Unless you are completely coming up with a totally niche product that has not been seen in the market then you may not need to worry much about design. Until someone or a cooperations creates the same product with an amazing design and with just similar pricing range. It then starts realising consumers are loyal to products that are more welcoming to need in terms of appearance and usage of the SAAS product.
