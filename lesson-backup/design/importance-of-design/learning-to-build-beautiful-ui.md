title: Learn to Build Beautiful UIs
chapter: 1
lesson: 3
---


In the following lessons, we'll learn the basics of creating wonderful UI's(user interface) for apps, CMS's(Content Management Systems) and Dashboards(If you're not familiar with these terms, please refer to your facilitator). User Interface is the first impression you make to the end users. You've always heard that the first impression is always vital for any interview and that is accompanied with the way you're dressed from your head to your toes and the way you conduct yourself such as interpersonal skills etc. It is the same thing with UI, you always want to impress your users with great looks and experience of your solution.

> The way you'd prepare for an interview is the same way you'd prepare for creating UI and the same way you'd like to impress during an interview is the same way your UI should impress users. 

There are many ways to approach UI, There are thousands of articles on how to approach design on the internet but we've tried to simplify the complexities of learning a thousand ways of doing the same thing by preparing the following steps. 

**Step 1:**

Familiarise yourself with design principles of both iOS and Android to help you in building amazing and relevant designs for each platform or according to the requirements.

Android and IOS have different principles that you go through both principles to align yourself with either platform. Both these platforms(Google Play Store and Apple App Store) will not allow your app on their respective app stores unless you adhere to their design principles. This includes but not limited to icons, layout, button sizes, image backgrounds etc. For full understanding of these principles, please explore the following: 

- https://material.io/develop/android/ 
- https://material.io/develop/ios/ 
- https://material.io/develop/web/ 

**Activity:**

- As you may have learnt about icons, can you download any type of an icon
- from the internet to use it on your project?
- What is the best format for your icons?
- Explain what do you understand by primary colour, primary colour dark and
- accent colour in android design principles.
- Discuss with your other colleagues on the importance of responsiveness
- and on what makes great design.

To be good in design, you must befriend material.io.

**Step 2:**

By now you should have an idea and knowledge on the design principles of each platform. For the next step, we will list what we think are the most important things to do as soon as you have all the specifications for the project. 

While putting everything you have learnt into considerations;

- Document and realise the scope of the project in point form. 
- From your points above, group items that you think are related. 
- Before creating wireframes, map out a target user flow of your project. Please refer to the image link below:

https://miro.medium.com/max/2800/0*5OwU4KmsV9tQt2e5.png

Now sketch out using pencil and paper a wireframe. An example of a wireframe is;![img](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WI6h2cJMzY3TGJXNyS8oKrvSqsfiZQLLVfZ4MunZyacGBMC5FleRy5VBKbkpD5PAAyhtqrjv0BTFnwKXdW_3ESnwYR3Up1IaPCCj92t_Dm66mgHnggTyKVnYtpBl-T4oyVTZ9ze-)

- 
  The above example demonstrates wireframes of a mobile view of the project with navigation of each screen. This is how wireframes should look like and you are welcome to use freehand for your wireframes. 
- Take great care to the amount of screens(or pages). 
- The number of screens must be kept to a minimum but still be able to achieve the main goal of the project. 
- Keep in mind that for each screen you add to your project, you're adding a navigation backlog for the user.
- Do not add unnecessary screens. 
- Please take note that most modern phones have bigger screens, so make sure users can have ease in using your app(Usability is precious). 
- Take note of all usability events I.e. one handed, cradled and two handed.

- Keep the project to the simplest form it can be.
- Keep the user in your thoughts throughout the sketching and wireframing process.

**Step 3**

The branding(of the company or the project itself)

In short, branding should include but not limited to colours, drive the core values and beliefs of the project etc. 

Find inspiration to achieve this by sifting through thousands of good designs. 

Find something refreshing and completely exciting to do.

 For inspiration, please refer to the following website: 

* [https://ww.uplabs.com](https://ww.uplabs.com/)
* https://za.pinterest.com/
* https://dribble.com/

**Activity**

* Explain what you understand by branding and why is it important for any project.
* Would you prefer to look through other designs for inspiration or would you prefer to come up with your own designs without looking at other designs? Make sure to explain why you would do that?
* Share with your colleagues any best design you saw on either of the above websites and explain why that design.

**Step 4**

* Pick a design software, preferably adobe XD or Figma for prototyping or designing your project.
* Implement your freehand wireframe sketches as a living version with colours on the above suggested platforms.
* To learn more about figma, please watch this 4min Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sAAa-CCOcg
* To learn briefly about Adobe XD, please watch this 11 min Youtube video: :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3naMbrEzcg

**Step 5**

* If your team or yourself or the client is satisfied with the implementation of the live mockups, navigation, use of colours and branding, you are now ready to code the exact designs in any programming platform but In our case, we'll use Ionic Framework(this may change with time).
* Note that you may be required to constantly adapt the screens on sprintly bases as we're using Scrum Methodology but always keep your sketches updated and with every change, note the version of your sketches or designs(This helps to track changes made throughout the project). This can also be done on Trello(trello.com) which you'll be introduced to during the training.
* Make sure it's responsive across all different platforms and devices such as desktop, web, mobile(which can include a vast range of smartphones and/or tables/ipads).
* Get an opinion of others when you're convinced you're done. I.e a friend or a colleague.

**Step 6**

* Lastly we test the design against the initial scope and the designs presented on XD or Figma.
* If any changes or adjustments need to be made, this is the best time to do so.
* Retest to finish current version of the project.

The project scope and designs may evolve during scrum iterations and during the introduction of new versions of the app. So keep an open mind to always find better ways of solving and improving usability problems/bugs and simplifying the usability to its lowest form"Other resources you may use and please feel free to also recommend what you think can be useful in design:

* Photoshop
* Sketch
* Adobe Illustrator
* After effects
* Bootstrap

**Articles to better line you up with design are as follows:**

* https://www.toptal.com/designers/mobile-ui/fundamental-guide-mobile-usability
* https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/08/bottom-navigation-pattern-mobile-web-pages/

**Additionally**

* "Note, there are many ways to approach design but the one that wins is the simple one.
* "Design is very psychological, it's about convincing the mind of the user to remain engaged to the screen for the longest time. It's about creating a world a user cannot live without.
* "Think of yourself as a visionary and a transformer"

**Some questions we can engage on are as follows:**

* Why do mobile screen keyboards appear at the bottom of the screen and not in the middle or at the top?
* In which usability events can we possibly use long press?
* What is your favourite app design and why?
* Explain why would you use sidemenu over bottom navigation and vice versa?
* Compare One UI(by Samsung) skin that runs onto Android and mobile IOS design. 
* Which one do you think is more usable and why?
* In which circumstances do you decide to create an app or website?
* Watch the following video about the new iPad Pro(2020): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnZeDt2c8Yo
* Can this iPad design approach by Apple replace laptops in the near future and why?

These above principles apply everywhere for design irrespective of the platform one is using but the good thing is that resources for web development have been developed over a very long time and this plays to your advantage when using Ionic Framework which makes use of these web tools you might be familiar with. Web resources are widely available and you shouldn't struggle to get started with any web related technologies such as the Ionic Framework. Building a solid UI(User Interface) structure requires some technical abilities and developing these abilities will take a bit of time but don't worry you'll master it in no time with dedication. When I started developing HTML web pages I used tables to create a structure but now that is obsolete as modern web page structures are much more complex than back then but to solve this challenge we'll be using flex boxes which you may be familiar but if not, don't worry, you'll learn too.

For the purpose of this training, we'll focus more on flex boxes in creating solid structures for our UI and to get started, please click on the below links to learn more about flex boxes.

* https://www.w3schools.com/csS/css3_flexbox.asp
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox
* Optional(20minutes Youtube video)l: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJSoEo8JSn

You can also use additional tools, resources or libraries to implement the following design but take note to align any of the tools you'll be using with flex boxes. Remember: if flex boxes are becoming too difficult to understand, don't worry, you're getting it.

**Activity**

* Carefully look at the following 3 screens UI and do the following.

![screens-ui](images/learning-to-build-beautiful-ui/screens-ui.png)

Image Source:

https://www.templatemonster.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Mobile-UI-UX-Design-Trends-7.png

Start by sketching the 3 screens on paper as learnt previously, including a login and a registration screen, which will amount to 5 screens in the end. Follow the steps listed above to achieve great results. Implement the 5 screens using the Ionic Framework and take note of the following:

* The UI must be responsive.
* You can brand the UI anyhow you'd like to.
* You can change the content to suit what you're passionate about.
* You can also integrate any library of your choice to bring the best results to fruition such as bulma.io, bootstrap etc.

Lastly, Ionic Framework has organised a good documentation to help you understand some of the fundamentals of front-end design using their framework. To learn more about Ionic layout and theming, please explore the following links:

* https://ionicframework.com/docs/layout/structure
* Responsive Grid
* Global Stylesheets
* CSS Utilities
* https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/basics
* CSS Variables
* Colors
* You may explore others depending on your enthusiasm
