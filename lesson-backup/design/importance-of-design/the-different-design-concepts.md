Google has spent years of research creating a design methodology called Material Design. It was first introduced through the rapid growth in development of android native apps(Back in the Java days). It was made to help assist developers build better looking products that made consumers lives easier to interact with the products. This was of great benefit to google as Applications on the Google play Store started to get more attractive apps users, users were more willing to download apps from the google play store.  Please refer to https://material.io to read more about Material Design principles.

Material Design concepts have then grown into the web through the use of web components. Due to the rapid growth of cross-platform technology, those same web components are now used in building desktop applications.

Apple later introduced its own design principles to allow developers to build better products for mac and iphones that take full advantage of what their platform is capable of doing in terms of design.
