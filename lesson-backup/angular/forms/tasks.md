## Task 1

Angular forms have controls that help you create alerts that help the user to enter the right information or fill a required input.  [angular-forms.md](angular-forms.md) 

Create an angular form app that requires the user to enter their name(required), surname(required), email address(required), date of birth(required), phone number(not required) and address(not required).

Should the user not enter any of the required fields, the button must remain displayed. When all required fields are entered then the button should be enabled.

## Task 2

If user(s) skips an input, there should be a message that appears that tells the user to enter data into the input(HTML text). Once user(s) enter the data, the message should disappear.
