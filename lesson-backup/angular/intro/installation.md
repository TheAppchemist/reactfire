1. Please install Node.js(https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. Follow the steps on this website(https://angular.io/guide/setup-local). Please make sure to create your first Angular Application using those steps to confirm if Angular has been installed properly.
3. Download VS Code. It is the preferred Integrated Development environment(IDE) to use at CodeTribe. Due to it being lightweight. Avoid Atom IDE. It uses up a lot of memory.
