If you look at the example above, this is how your paths in angular will be setup. The path with the empty string(' ') becomes the default path of your angular app. Routes is imported from the router module and it has an array that takes an object with two variables(path and component). 

The component variable points to the component you would have created using your terminal. The path variable name can be anything you would like to name it but preferably name it a name that is similar to your component name. For example; component TestComponent has a path of 'test'

## Task 1

Attach the method to a button that you will place on your test.component.html. When you do a button press it should navigate you to the next page which is page1 in this case.
