Promise - is a way of performing asynchronous functions/tasks. Promises handle events at a certain period of time. Presented using .then

Observables - is an interface that handles a variety of common asynchronous functions/tasks. Require you to subscribe to then and unsubscribe to them when you have completed your particular task. Represented using the .subscribe, .map and .pipe. Please refer to the angular documentation(https://angular.io/guide/observables).
