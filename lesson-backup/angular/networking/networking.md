Angular Networking is the use of http calls;

* get - retrieve data from the server.

* post - write data to the server.

* update- update a record from the server. 

  

Here are three great example websites you can refer to for future reference;

* https://www.tutorialspoint.com/angular4/angular4_http_service.htm
* https://jasonwatmore.com/post/2019/11/21/angular-http-post-request-examples.

Your Http calls must be placed into a service/provider.

For example;

Entering  ng g service services/networking terminal will create a folder called services and then create your service named networking.

Always make sure to create a service folder where all your services/providers will be created and located.
