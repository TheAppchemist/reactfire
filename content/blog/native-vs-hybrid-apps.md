After reading this article you will be able to differentiate between two types of mobile development model. We are looking at native and hybrid app development.

## **Native App**

Choosing to develop an app which will be only used for a particular operating system then native app development would be a best choice. For instance, if you’re developing an app for IOS then you have to write iOS applications in Objective-C or Swift. When developing an Android-native apps you will use Java.

### **Native App Disadvantages**

Although native apps may have their own advantages. In business perceptive they’re likely to be challenging. The developers might not meet the deadline and also cost more to develop. Here’s why:

- You get to develop multiple code bases because each device has its own version of the app.
- The cost for additional developers to build and manage a code base for each platform.
- Time spent on multiple builds for separate platforms in each feature update.

## **Hybrid App**

Hybrid app development supports cross operating system platforms. This makes it possible to embed HTML5 apps inside a thin native container. If you are planning to create a mobile application, choosing the hybrid model will save you time and effort and you can reuse the code for creating a web application version too. Hybrid apps makes life simple for developers. Hybrid app development enables you to develop the code once and build mobile applications that run on the main platforms with no extra effort.  Developers can run the app on Android and iOS and the code can be reused for progressive web applications and even desktop applications.

Looking at Native vs Hybrid apps, the most appeals of hybrid app development is that you get to code an app once and then you release it across multiple platforms. While on native app development you are required to individually code for multiple platforms.
